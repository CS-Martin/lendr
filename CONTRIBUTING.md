- Use descriptive PR titles and provide context in the description.

### Commit Message Conventions

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to keep our commit history clean and meaningful. Please use the following structure for your commit messages:

```
type(scope?): subject

body? (optional, longer explanation)

footer? (optional, e.g. BREAKING CHANGE or issue reference)
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding or correcting tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**
- `feat(api): add rental endpoint`
- `fix(client): correct rental post display bug`
- `docs: update README with getting started instructions`
- `chore: update dependencies`
- `refactor(api): simplify user service logic`

For more details, see the [Conventional Commits documentation](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
